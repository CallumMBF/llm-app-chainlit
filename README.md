### Technical Report: LangChain-Chainlit RAG Application

#### 1. Introduction
This report details the development, deployment, and maintenance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built using LangChain and Chainlit. The application is containerized using Docker and can be deployed locally or on Google Cloud using Cloud Run.

#### 2. Technology Stack
- **LangChain:** A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
- **Chainlit:** A tool for creating chat-based interfaces.
- **Docker:** A containerization platform that ensures consistency across environments.
- **Google Cloud Run:** A serverless container deployment service for scalable cloud deployment.
- **Poetry:** A dependency management and packaging tool for Python projects.

#### 3. Local Development

##### 3.1 Environment Setup
The application leverages Poetry for dependency management. Follow these steps to set up the local development environment:

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

To update dependencies after modifying `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
poetry install
poetry lock
poetry shell
```

##### 3.2 Running the Application
To run the Chainlit server locally:

```bash
chainlit run demo_app/main.py
```

This command initiates the Chainlit server, allowing local testing and development.

#### 4. Docker Implementation

##### 4.1 Building the Docker Image
To containerize the application, build the Docker image with the following commands:

```bash
docker build --force-rm --no-cache -t [IMAGE_NAME]:latest .
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --target=runtime . -t [IMAGE_NAME]:latest
```

These commands create a Docker image tagged as `latest`, ensuring a clean and optimized build process.

##### 4.2 Running the Docker Container
Run the Docker container directly or using `docker-compose`:

```bash
docker run -d --name [IMAGE_NAME] -p 8000:8000 [IMAGE_NAME]
docker-compose up
```

These commands start the container, making the application accessible on port 8000.

#### 5. Google Cloud Deployment

##### 5.1 Prerequisites
Ensure the following are set up:
- **Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)** or **gcloud-lite**
- A Google Cloud project with billing enabled
- Necessary Google Cloud APIs enabled:
  - Cloud Build
  - Cloud Run

##### 5.2 Configuration
Key configuration steps include:
1. Creating a new project.
2. Setting up service accounts with appropriate permissions.
3. Enabling required services.

##### 5.3 Container Registry
Push the Docker image to Google Cloud Artifacts Registry:
1. Create a repository.
2. Configure Docker authentication.
3. Push the container image:

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker
docker tag [IMAGE_NAME]:latest [YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION]-docker.pkg.dev/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/[REPOSITORY]/[IMAGE_NAME]:latest
docker push [YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION]-docker.pkg.dev/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/[REPOSITORY]/[IMAGE_NAME]:latest
```

##### 5.4 Cloud Run Deployment
Deploy the application using Cloud Run with the following command:

```bash
gcloud run deploy [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] \
  --image=[YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION]-docker.pkg.dev/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/[REPOSITORY]/[IMAGE_NAME]:latest \
  --region=[YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION] \
  --service-account=[YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL] \
  --port=8000 \
  --memory=2G
```

This command deploys the containerized application, specifying region, service account, port, and memory allocation.

#### 6. Maintenance and Troubleshooting

- For Codespace users: Regularly clean up Docker resources to manage space.
- Use the command `docker system prune` to clean up unused Docker resources.
- Monitor Cloud Run logs to troubleshoot deployment issues:

```bash
gcloud logs read --project=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID] --resource-type=cloud_run_revision
```

#### 7. Conclusion
This RAG application showcases a robust implementation using modern tools and cloud deployment techniques. It offers flexibility in deployment options, leveraging LangChain and Chainlit for building interactive, AI-powered chat interfaces. Docker ensures consistency across different environments, while Google Cloud deployment provides scalability and ease of management. Continuous improvement and monitoring will ensure the application's effectiveness and performance in production environments.

ðŸ“– Lano LLM app using Langchain, Chainlit and Docker Deployment
</h1>


## ðŸ”§ Features

- Configured with `openai` API
- A ChatBot using LangChain and Chainlit
- Docker Support
- Deployment on Google Cloud using `Cloud Run`

> Heavily influenced by repository:  https://github.com/amjadraza/langchain-chainlit-docker-deployment-template


## ðŸ’» Running Locally


Install dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and activate virtual environmentðŸ”¨

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```
Any changes to [tool.poetry.dependencies] in the pyproject.toml file will need to run 
```bash
poetrty.install
poetry lock
poetry shell
```

Run the Chainlit server
```bash
chainlit run demo_app/main.py
```

Run App using Docker
--------------------

for codespace you may run out of space. occasionally use to clean up containers etc. 
docker system prune 

to see space on codespace
df -h

remove all containers
docker container prune -f

remove image
docker rmi <image id>

build the docker image without cache
docker build --force-rm --no-cache -t [IMAGE_NAME]:latest .


run a container in bash so you can be inside the container and find files
docker run -it <image id> /bin/bash

Build the docker container and view the logs of the build in docker_build.log file (auto created)
docker  build . -t [IMAGE_NAME]:latest > docker_build.log 2>&1

and without cache
docker  build . -t [IMAGE_NAME]:latest --no-cache > docker_build.log 2>&1

run a temporary cntainer for testing
docker run --rm lano-llm-app

To generate Image with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT`, follow below command
```DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --target=runtime . -t [IMAGE_NAME]:latest```

1. Run the docker container directly 
``docker run -d --name [IMAGE_NAME] -p 8000:8000 [IMAGE_NAME] ``


2. Run the docker container using docker-compose (Recommended)
``docker-compose up``


Deploy App on Google Cloud using Cloud Run (RECOMMENDED)
--------------------------------------------------------
This app can be deployed on Google Cloud using Cloud Run following below steps.

## Prerequisites

Google's gcloud CLI distribution is bloated with unnecessary dependencies including a complete python3 installation and large anthos binary. This results in slower instance boot times, and costly storage & transfer fees
Reference: https://github.com/tonymet/gcloud-lite

Google's gcloud CLI distribution
#curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-474.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
#tar -xf google-cloud-cli-474.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

GCloud-Lite is a distribution of the CLI that strips these unnessary dependencies to reduce the size by > 75%
GCloud-Lite
curl -LO https://github.com/tonymet/gcloud-lite/releases/download/472.0.0/google-cloud-cli-472.0.0-linux-x86_64-lite.tar.gz
tar -zxf *gz

./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh


Main steps to Deploy
Initialise & Configure the App
First create a project in GCP console

gcloud auth login
gcloud auth list
# for new project
gcloud app create --project=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
#gcloud config set project llm-app-project
Provide billing account for this project by running gcloud beta billing accounts list OR you can do it manually from the GCP console.

# for new project
Enable Services for the Project: We have to enable services for Cloud Run using below set of commands
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
#Create Service Accounts with Permissions

gcloud iam service-accounts create [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] \
    --display-name="[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]"
e.g.
gcloud iam service-accounts create lano-llm-app \
    --display-name="lano-llm-app"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] \
    --member="serviceAccount:[YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]" \
    --role="roles/run.invoker"    

e.g.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding llm-app-project \
    --member="serviceAccount:lano-llm-app@llm-app-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/run.invoker"	

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding llm-app-project \
    --member="serviceAccount:[YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]" \
    --role="roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] \
    --member="serviceAccount:[YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]" \
    --role="roles/run.admin"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] \
    --member="serviceAccount:[YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]" \
    --role="roles/storage.objectViewer"
