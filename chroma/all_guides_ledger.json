Instead, Active Ledger calculates the depreciation on each asset, so that we can measure each asset's contribution towards all the relevant pool balances and calculations. For this reason, Active Ledger allows you to continue working out asset group based totals even if some of those assets are in a pool.

You may find that when you connect your client's source file (such as Xero, MYOB or QBO) to a dataset, that your closing balances per your clients accounts as at the last finalised year may not agree to what you have in your comparative year dataset from your practice ledger (where the financial statements are issued from). This would occur due to not having pushed balancing/alignment entries to the client file in the past, or if the client has backdated transactions to previous financial years. Please refer to the Glossary for definitions of key terms used in this article."

            "Context": "In general, it is advisable that each entity only has one Active Ledger file. You are able to create more than one dataset in each file (i.e. a dataset for 2021, 2022, Mid-Year 2023, budget etc). You would usually only have multiple Active Ledger files per entity where you want to experiment with copies of data or want to arrange an alternative chart of accounts. Please refer to the Glossary for definitions of key terms used in this article. Active Ledger file steps Step 1: Create and import a dataset (datasets screen) A dataset is a group of data, at its simplest form a trial balance, imported into the Active Ledger file. A dataset can contain all transactions for a certain period and can import monthly, quarterly, yearly data points into the system. This offers a wide range of flexibility when reporting. For more information, refer to the dataset related articles sitting in the User Guides section. Step 2: Allocate client accounts to the Active Ledger chart of accounts (accounts screen) Importing data from sources (i.e. MYOB, Xero, Excel, etc.) into an entity creates accounts in the system. These accounts need to be mapped into their reporting categories. This is a mostly automated process and only requires a little tweaking. For more information, refer to the accounts related articles sitting in the User Guides section. Step 3: Connect to and complete Workpapers (workpapers screen) Active Ledger connects to Active Workpapers and Business Fitness Smart Workpapers Suite . The Workpapers at their core import data from Active Ledger and allow auto-completion of reconciliation fields and form the base for compiling compliance jobs. To find out more about Active Workpapers, see the knowledge article: Getting started guide (Active Workpapers) . Step 4: Complete asset reporting (assets screen) The assets module is a complete asset management solution, providing features such as accounting and taxation depreciation, pooling, disposal of asset calculations etc.. In addition, it integrates with the reporting module to complement the financial reports. For more information, refer to the assets related articles sitting in the User Guides section. Step 5: Preparing reports (reports screen) The reporting module is the output of all the other modules. It is a feature-rich reporting set which provides full financial reports and includes customisable notes and accounting policies. Reports can be printed by division and can also include trading accounts. For more information, refer to the reporting related articles sitting in the User Guides section.

            "Article Objective": "To assist users in navigating the Active Platform to import a trial balance using Excel when the user does not have direct access to the clients accounting software or if the software is not listed as one of the integrated cloud sources. If you have not yet connected to a source, see Knowledge Article: Datasets - manage sources .",
            "Context": "A source is where the financial information is being imported from into Active Ledger & Reporting (e.g. MYOB, Xero, etc.). Please refer to the Glossary for definitions of key terms used in this article. Import preparation Once you have connected your dataset to Excel as a source, as below, the trial balance can be imported using the import facility in the Excel add-in. Note: If you have not already done so, you can download the Excel add-in directly from Microsoft AppSource by clicking here . Alternatively, you can follow the installation details in the knowledge article: How to install the Excel add-in . To confirm this add-in has worked, open Excel. An Active Ledger toolbar should be visible in the Excel ribbon under the home tab. Import formatting To begin, export your financial data from the clients accounting file into an Excel spreadsheet, or construct a trial balance using Excel cells. The Active Ledger Excel import utility will accept data in one of four formats based on the number of columns you select: 1. Three columns: The three column method assumes that the first column is the account name, the second column is for debits and the third is for credits. Note: If you have amounts in only one column with the credits displayed as negative amounts, you can still select three columns (selecting a blank column for the third column) and Active Ledger will split the amounts for the import journal. 2. Four columns: The fourth column method adds an account number column before the other columns described above. 3. Five columns: The fifth column method adds a classification column before the other columns described above. Refer to the 'Other notes' section of this article for more information. 4. Six columns: The six column method allows you to add either a memo, quantity or division column for the final column to further classify your data. Other notes With the five or six column formats, the account numbers can be left blank if desired, as Active Ledger does not require an account number Active Ledger does not require headers to import correctly as it will assume your columns are in the orders provided above Active Ledger does not mind the use of blank lines or header accounts and the like, however it will assume that every line with a value in the debit or credit column is a valid account that needs to be imported. That is, you will need to remove any lines with totals in them (note that in the 'Importing trial balance' section below, when the data was highlighted, the total row was included in this) If you used the three or four column format, you will need to select the classification for each account before the journal is able to be posted The classification is used by Active Ledger to help automatically link accounts to the master chart of accounts. Once an account is linked to the master chart of accounts the classification loses its relevance. In the Excel import process, it will automatically link the following text to classifications as shown below: Classification Valid Text Strings Asset \"Asset\", \"Assets\" or \"A\" Liability \"Liability\", \"Liabilities\" or \"L\" Equity \"Equity\", \"Capital\" or \"E\" Revenue \"Revenue\", \"Income\", or \"R\" Cost of Goods Sold \"COGS\", \"Cost\", \"Cost of Goods Sold\", \"Direct Cost/s\" or \"C\" Expense \"Expense\", \"Expenses\" or \"X\" Other All other text strings, including \"O\" Importing trial balance Highlight the data you wish to import, ensuring the total row is not highlighted, and select Import Data. Once this is selected, a slide-out screen will appear. Select Login and the login page will pop-up on the screen. Enter your Active credentials. Once logged in, you will be brought to a screen where you need to select the client Active Ledger file by using the search bar, and selecting the relevant dataset. Also ensure the correct"
