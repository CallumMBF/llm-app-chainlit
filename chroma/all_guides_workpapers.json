T ABLE OF CONTENTS Setting up your screen to add a record to a binder Add another record Linking a document Linking to an account general ledger Linking to an external value Linking a document within a worksheet cell Setting up your screen to add a record to a binder Once you have created a binder and linked a data source, you can link documents to relevant trial balance accounts in the index screen (both in the web and in the Excel taskpane). If you have two screens available, it's advisable to open the Excel workbook on one and the web browser on the other. If you're working with a single screen, open the Excel workbook and utilize the task pane for web access. For more information regarding using the online or Excel binder, see the knowledge article: How to use online and Excel binder . Linking a record template To add a record, click the ' Add Record ' button located on the right-hand side of the account line. Choose the recommended bank record template. A bank record template will populate the Excel binder, likely on your second screen. The bank name and balance date ought to auto-fill using the data in the binder. If this does not happen, or the information is incorrect, you have the option to manually adjust it. Proceed to input the remaining bank details, such as the BSB, account number, and the balance as per the statement. The reconciliation indicator on the record template will turn green. A green tick on the index signifies a two-way match between the record template and the general ledger. Click on the checklist icon next to the specific line item. The screen will present a series of questions for your attention. Kindly select the relevant checkboxes and provide responses to the corresponding questions. Note that your admin team may add extra items to the checklist if needed. Click \"Close\" when finished. Then, select the page icon as shown below. A window will display giving you the option to add a document. Select click here to add your document Choose your document and click ' Open ' to save it against your trial balance item. Finally, make sure to set the status to ' Ready for Review '. Add another record Next, let's proceed to the next account and choose 'Add Record'. There are various types of records, including Record Templates, links to Existing Sheets, Comments, General Ledger information, and links to External Values. We will explore some of these shortly. Example: Adding a comment Select Add Record and select Comment Add your relevant note and save and close . Finally, ensure the status is set to In Progress . One account is ready for review, and the second account is in progress. Adding a trade debtors record template Navigate to your Trade Debtors account, click on 'Add Record,' and then choose 'Trade Debtors. A trade debtors record template will be added to the Excel binder. When the binder is linked to a Xero or QBO file, it will automatically populate a list of debtors in the template. If there is no connection to a Xero or QBO file, the information must be entered manually. The reconciliation indicator will turn green on the record template, and a green tick will appear on the index to indicate that there is a two-way match between the record template and the general ledger. Hint: When filling out the record template, we recommend you minimise the taskpane by using the arrows on the left-hand side of the taskpane to do so. To finalise the record template to ensure it is ready for review, select the Checklist Icon complete the checklist carefully. Close the window when you have finished Finally, ensure the status is set to Ready for Review. Linking a document Example: Adding a document and reconciling against the document only Click Add Record on the right-hand side of the account. Select + Add Record from the display The following screen will display. You can either drag and drop, click to upload or add a hyperlink to a document to add. Additionally, you are able to add a document stored locally, in Active, FYI Docs or HowNow X. The documents that are stored in Active includes all the documents which have been linked to the accounts - this is an automatic process. In this example, drag and drop a file into the designated area. A pop-up window will appear; enter the reconciliation amount and confirm that the document is properly linked. If necessary, you can add additional documents. Click Save and Close. Finally, ensure the status is set to Ready for Review as demonstrated above. Linking to an existing sheet Example 1: Linking to the existing bank record template Click Add Record then click + Add Record from the dropdown menu The following screen will display. Select Link to Existing Sheet. Select the F10 Bank record template. Select the appropriate bank account to link the record template to. Click Save and Close. The existing bank record template will be populated to the Excel binder. Hint: When filling out the record template, we recommend you minimise the taskpane by using the arrows on the left-hand side of the taskpane to do so. The bank name and balance date should pre-populate using the information already in the binder. If it has not or is incorrect, you are able to manually override this information. Enter the remaining bank details, including the BSB, account # and balance per the statement. The reconciliation indicator will turn green on the record template, and a green tick will appear on the index to indicate that there is a two-way match between the record template and the general ledger. As you have already completed the checklist items for the Bank record template and are linking the same template to another bank account, you will not be required to complete this again. The record template will now be reconciled. Finally, ensure the status is set to Ready for Review. Example 2: Creating your own worksheet and use the link to existing sheet feature For information on how to create your own worksheet and use the link to existing sheet feature, see knowledge article: How to add your own worksheet to a binder . Linking to an account general ledger Select your trial balance line item and Add Record then + Add Record The following screen will pop-up. Select General Ledger. The reconciliation field will pre-populate to be the account balance, and Rollover this record will be ticked. Keep this ticked if you want the record template to be rolled over to the following year as a record recommendation. Click Save and Close. The general ledger for the account will be populated to the Excel binder. The general ledger will pull data from any of the integrated cloud accounting files including Xero, MYOB, QBO, etc.. If the binder is not connected to an integrated cloud accounting file, manual input will be required. The reconciliation indicator will turn green on the record template, and a green tick will appear on the index to indicate that there is a two-way match between the record template and the general ledger. The record will now be reconciled. Finally, ensure the status is set to Ready for Review. Linking to an external value Within Active Workpapers you have the ability to link a value from one clients binder to another. This is generally used for inter-entity loans, for example. To link to an external value, click Add Record then + Add Record The following screen will pop-up. Select Link to External Value. This will trigger a drop-down list with three options: link to external field, link to external account or link to Active Ledger account. Click External Account - this is the most commonly used option. Select the binder you wish to extract an account value from. In this example, I am going to select the Johnston & Co Pty Ltd 2023 Accounts and Tax binder. Select the account you wish to reconcile against. In this example, I am going to link the Loan: Johnston Family Trust (2023) account. Give the record a title and review the information, click Save and Close. The value will be populated to the Excel binder. A green tick will appear on the index to indicate that there is a two-way match between the external binder value and the general ledger. The record will now be reconciled. Finally, ensure the status is set to Ready for Review. Linking a document within a worksheet cell Within Active Workpapers you have the ability to link a supporting document within a worksheet cell. For this example, we will add a document link to the bank record template. To do this, navigate to the worksheet, and right click on the cell you wish to link the document to. Hover over the Active Workpapers option and select Add Document Link. The following screen will pop-up. You can either drag and drop, click to upload or add a hyperlink to a document to add. Additionally, you are able to add a document stored locally, in Active, FYI Docs or HowNow X. The documents that are stored in Active includes all the documents which have been linked to the accounts - this is an automatic process. For this example, we will drag & drop a file into the box. Click Save. The document link will populate into the cell you clicked on, and an icon will show next to the record template showing that a document is linked . To view this document, you can either click on the hyperlink or select the icon next to the record template. You can repeat this process as many times as you wish. Finally, ensure the status is set to Ready for Review.

            "Context": "Active Workpapers allows you to manage your binder online in conjunction with your Excel file. Alternatively, you can work entirely within Excel. The taskpane in Excel will mirror the details on the web and the two will always be fully synchronised, there is no need to refresh. This way you could work with your online Index on one screen and your Excel file on another. Please refer to the Glossary for definitions of key terms used in this article. Choosing to use the online or Excel binder You are able to choose whether you work online or in Excel, however you will always need to use Excel to create the supporting records and worksheets associated with your index. With this, we recommend that i f you have access to two screens, you open the Excel binder on one and the web on the other. Where you are only on one screen, we recommend opening the Excel binder and using the taskpane. Essentially the web shows the account balances, all the workpapers that are linked to the accounts and the statuses of workpapers. You are also able to perform journals, add internal notes and client queries, access all documents which have been uploaded into Workpapers, manage accounts and access the QA centre. The Excel binder is largely only used to upload and complete workpapers, however has all the capabilities of the web accessible in the taskpane. Tip: The synchronisation between the web and Excel also allows multiple people to work on the binder at the same time. Clicking on the Active Users button in either the web or Excel will show you who is working on the file. Opening and using the Excel binder Navigate to the relevant client and c lick on the Wp icon. Open the relevant binder. This will open the binder in the web. To access the Excel binder, click on Open Binder in Excel. After opening the file, a pop-up screen will prompt you to sign in. Enter your Business Fitness details. Once signed in, a taskpane will appear on the right-hand side of the file. This taskpane will synchronise with the online binder and you may choose to use either or both to work on your job, depending on your preference. Tip: The taskpane in Excel can be 'popped out' or resized, and moved to another screen for ease of use. Simply hover your cursor over the 'Active Workpapers' header until a cross appears and click and drag. If you wish to navigate back to the web from the Excel binder, click Open Website.
